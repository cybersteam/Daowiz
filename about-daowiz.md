<a>Planet earth has some serious challenges as you may well know, many of them caused by human activities. We are on a mission to do our small part in improving the situation by regenerating land that has degenerated due to farming or urban activity and conserving land that may be under threat by invasive species and other factors arising by our growing population world wide. We recognise that all human activity can be summed up by the interaction between our minds, our technology and the resources we use across the planet. Our aim is to do whatever we can in these three areas to make a measurable, positive impact on how our future eco-systems evolve.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
Daowiz is a collective of artists, creatives, engineers, conservationists and organisers who care deeply about the future of humanity within the context of our natural environment. Over the past 30 years we have consistently studied and explored the depths of the changing socio-economic landscape, rapid technological advancements as well as the equally rapid decline in natureâ€™s eco-systems in a quest to find ways of bringing about a healthier, more sustainable future.

<h3>What we do?</h3>
We create new narratives of a better future through arts, music and media.
We provide technology consulting, products and services to future-proof businesses, individuals, organizations, communities and ecosystems.
We activate unused or degraded land to improve these ecosystems.
We assist individuals with building better lives that are aligned with the balance of nature.


<h3>Our commercial offerings are:</h3>
Consultation, creative work and products, technology solutions, arts, music, engineering and prototyping, conservation in action, community work, food solutions and more.
